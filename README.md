## About This Project

Alright, we have all been there. When your loving partner is sometimes a little sad and curious and just can't help wondering what you did for the day that you spent without seeing them. Well, this was my answer after brainstorming an idea for my anniversary. Here is a website that is cute and filled with smooth transitions that I kind of built from scratch^^ Beyond that, we have a data base system built with laravel and sql that allows the user to record what they did for the day(without seeing their loved ones,(You should come up with something good)) and when the day comes, showcase it to them in a organized format. The logging system also features possible image inclusion when want to add a picture to the side of the text.  you can do so by just adding the file name to the database with the date named and it will be automatically scaled beside your text.

## FrameWork

This project is built using Laravel and subsequently PHP with an overlay using React. Aside from using bootstrap for a fresh look on icons, the animations in background, front-page, and transitions between pages are built from just HTML and CSS.
